Groq Model Guide: Advantages & Use Cases
This document provides a summary of the key advantages for the general-purpose, English-language models available through your Groq API key. This can help in selecting the right model for different tasks within the Agentic Personal Porter project.
ðŸ‘‘ System-Level Models (Intelligent Agents)
These are more than just models; they are systems that can use tools and other models to achieve a goal.
1. groq/compound
Key Advantage: This is an AI system that can intelligently select other models and use built-in tools like web search and code execution on the server-side.
Best For: Complex tasks requiring up-to-date information or self-correction, where the system can figure out the best tool for the job without you needing to program it explicitly. This is a powerful choice for a high-level "analyst" agent.
2. groq/compound-mini
Key Advantage: A smaller, likely faster and more cost-effective version of the full compound system.
Best For: Everyday tasks that might benefit from simple tool use (like a quick web search) but don't require the full power of the larger system.
ðŸ’ª Large & Powerful Models (Deep Reasoning)
These models are ideal for tasks that require complex reasoning, nuance, and high-quality text generation.
1. openai/gpt-oss-120b
Key Advantage: A very large (120 billion parameters) open-source model from OpenAI. Its size suggests top-tier performance in complex reasoning, creative writing, and nuanced understanding.
Best For: The most demanding tasks, like the Socratic_Reflection_Agent's job of generating deeply insightful and empathetic questions.
2. llama-3.3-70b-versatile
Key Advantage: A flagship-level model from Meta's powerful Llama 3 series. The "versatile" tag indicates it's a strong generalist, excelling across a wide range of creative and analytical tasks.
Best For: A primary "workhorse" agent that needs to be both smart and reliable for various prompts.
3. deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
Key Advantage: A "distilled" model, meaning it's trained to capture the performance of a much larger model in a more efficient package. Deepseek is particularly known for strong coding and logical reasoning abilities.
Best For: Tasks that require rigorous logic or code interpretation.
ðŸš€ Mid-Range & Specialized Models
These models offer a balance of performance, speed, and unique capabilities.
1. qwen/qwen3-32b
Key Advantage: A solid mid-sized model from Alibaba's Qwen family, known for strong all-around performance and excellent instruction following.
Best For: General-purpose agentic tasks where reliability and good instruction-following are key.
2. meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct & meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct
Key Advantage: New-generation Llama 4 models from Meta. "Scout" may be tuned for speed and accuracy, while "Maverick" might be better for creative or unconventional tasks. Being instruction-tuned (instruct) makes them great for chat-based interactions.
Best For: Experimenting with cutting-edge models for specific agent roles.
3. moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct (and variants)
Key Advantage: An enormous context window. These models can process and reason over incredibly long texts (entire books, large codebases, etc.) without losing track of the details.
Best For: Future features that might involve summarizing long documents, analyzing a week's worth of journal entries, or processing large amounts of user-provided text.
âš¡ Fast & Efficient Models (Low Latency)
These models are optimized for speed and cost-effectiveness, making them ideal for simple, high-frequency tasks.
1. llama-3.1-8b-instant
Key Advantage: As the name implies, it's built for near-instantaneous responses. This is a smaller Llama 3.1 model optimized for extremely low latency.
Best For: The Goal_Ingestion_Agent, which performs a straightforward task of parsing text. Using a fast model here would make the user experience feel very responsive.
2. gemma2-9b-it
Key Advantage: A state-of-the-art model from Google for its size. Gemma models are known for being incredibly efficient and high-performing, punching well above their weight class.
Best For: A default choice for any task where a balance of speed, cost, and quality is needed. An excellent all-arounder.

Tier List for the Primary "PM" Porter
This is the central agent, the orchestrator. Its most important job is to understand the overall goal and select the right subsequent agent or tool.

Tier S (Top Recommendation): groq/compound

Reasoning: While it is a large system, it uniquely satisfies the "best tool for the job" principle in a meta-sense. A true Project Manager doesn't do all the work themselves; they delegate to the specialist best suited for the task. groq/compound is designed to do exactly this, using tools and selecting other models. For a PM Porter, this capability is more important than its raw conversational power. It's the most direct translation of your PM metaphor into a functional system.

Tier A (Strong Contender): deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b

Reasoning: I acknowledge your appreciation for this model, and it's well-founded. Its exceptional strength in logical reasoning makes it a fantastic choice for a PM that needs to analyze complex user entries and make deterministic decisions about the workflow. If the PM's primary role is analysis before delegation, this is arguably the best pure LLM for the job.

Tier B (Creative & Efficient Options): llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct & gemma2-9b-it

Reasoning: These are your third and fourth choices, and they are excellent. maverick could lead to a PM that offers more creative or unconventional insights, which is fascinating. gemma2-9b-it, as you noted, is a fantastic all-arounder. For the PM role, they are ranked slightly lower only because the core need is robust logic (Deepseek) or system-level delegation (Compound) over creativity or sheer efficiency. However, gemma2-9b-it could be a perfect starting point for an MVP to prove the concept before scaling up.

Recommendations for Follow-on Agents (Applying Your Principle)
Here is where we can be surgical and adhere strictly to using the smallest model that fits the need.

Goal_Ingestion_Agent (The Scribe)

Top Pick: llama-3.1-8b-instant

Reasoning: This agent's task is simple: parse text and extract structured information. It's a repetitive, non-creative task where speed is paramount for a good user experience. This model is explicitly built for low latency. Using any model larger than this would be computationally wasteful and a clear violation of our principle.

Socratic_Reflection_Agent (The Coach)

Top Pick: openai/gpt-oss-120b or llama-3.3-70b-versatile

Reasoning: This is the one place where computational size is justified. The task requires generating nuanced, empathetic, and non-repetitive questions that feel genuinely insightful. A smaller model would likely fall into patterns and sound robotic. The user-facing quality of this agent's output is critical, so using a large, powerful model is the right choice.

Inventory_Curator_Agent (The Librarian)

Top Pick: gemma2-9b-it

Reasoning: This agent's task is to take an insight and write a concise, one-line summary for a log. It needs to follow instructions perfectly but doesn't require the deep emotional reasoning of the Coach. gemma2-9b-it is a state-of-the-art model for its size and is perfect for this kind of reliable, structured text generation. It's the "just right" fit.
